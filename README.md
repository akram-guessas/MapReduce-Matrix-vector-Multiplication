# MapReduce-Matrix-vector-Multiplication
Matrix-vector product To define multiplication between a matrix A and a vector x (i.e., the matrix-vector product), we need to view the vector as a column matrix. We define the matrix-vector product only for the case when the number of columns in A equals the number of rows in x. So, if A is an m×n matrix (i.e., with n columns), then the product Ax is defined for n×1 column vectors x. If we let Ax=b, then b is an m×1 column vector. In other words, the number of rows in A (which can be anything) determines the number of rows in the product b.
